\vspace{5mm} 
Please adhere to the following rules:

\begin{itemize} 
\item This assignment should be submitted via Canvas. The file format should be either PDF or MS Word. Late assignments {\underline{will not be accepted}}.

    \item You should attempt to solve the problems
      on your own. You may discuss how to solve homework problems only at a high level, e.g., ``I used such and such theorem", or ``this chapter in the textbook handles a similar problem". Do not go further than this.
      
     \item  {\em You must write up your own solutions, in your own words}. Writing solutions jointly is not allowed.

\item Using large language models such as ChatGPT to find solutions, copying solutions from the Internet or asking
 students not enrolled in the class (or the class staff) is strictly prohibited. 

\item \underline{Please explain your answers}. There will be penalties for unexplained solutions when the answers are not obvious.

\item All submissions must be written using a word processor and submitted either as Word or PDF files. Handwritten submissions \underline{will not be accepted}.


\item The preferred word processor is Latex which supports professional quality typesetting. This document provides a template you can use for your homework papers.

\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}  

\item Let $k \ge 1$ be a fixed integer and consider the language over the alphabet $\Sigma = \{0, 1, 2\}$
\[ J_k = \{ w \in \{0, 1, 2\}^* \, | \, \text{the $k$-th symbol of $w$ equals 1} \} \]
What is the minimal number of states in a DFA which recognizes $J_k$? Prove your answer and provide an example of a minimal machine for $J_k$.

 \item Using the methods presented in figures 1.46, 1.48, and 1.50 in the textbook, construct an NFA that recognizes the language of the following regular expression
 \[ (a \cup b)^* b a \]
 Present the intermediate automata you obtained  while creating your final answer.

 \item  Let $A$ and $B$ be two regular languages over an alphabet $\Sigma$. Letâ€™s define the following operation on the sets $A, B$:
 \[ \begin{array}{l}
 A  \, \bigostar \, B = \\
  \{ w \in \Sigma^* \, | \, w = a_1 b_1 \cdots a_k b_k \text{ for some $k \ge 1$ and symbols $a_1, \ldots, a_k, b_1, \ldots, b_k \in \Sigma$}\\
  \hspace{1.35cm}\text{ such that $a_1\cdots a_k \in A$ and $b_1\cdots b_k \in B$} \}
  \end{array} \]     
 In other words, $A\,\bigostar \, B$ is the language of words that come from merging of all pairs of strings $u \in A$ and $v \in B$ that have the same length (i.e., $|u| = |v|$). Show that $A \, \bigostar \, B$ is regular.

\item Provide a regular expression for the language

\[ ((00)^*1)^* \cap ((000)^*1)^* \]
Note that neither $\cap$ nor $\overline{E}$ (complementation) are allowed symbols under regular expression rules.

 \item Convert the following NFA to an equivalent regular expression using the state-elimination method. Provide the intermediate diagrams you have obtained after elimination of each state.
